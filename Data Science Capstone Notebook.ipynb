There is even an annual competition held in May that attracts teams from all over the world. Is there an opportunity to popularize BBQ in Nashville. Memphis in May has been a great benefit for Memphis and the state if Tennessee. Is there an opportunity to bring a similar event to Nashville in the Fall to maximize the benefits for the state. The assumption if there are as many BBQ restaurants in downtown Nashville as in downtown Memphis, there is a potential for a good start to a BBQ festival/completion in Nashville.",
